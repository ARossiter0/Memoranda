# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Teacher Course Planning Tool

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: Tristan Johnson

**Git Master**: Alexander Rossiter

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** 
Our goal is to complete the course management tool by implementing the missing functionality for TA/grader tasks and sprints. We also intend to create functionality for uploading JSON data for each type of course element (todo items, lectures, assignments, and sprints). Finally, we want to refine some of the features for viewing daily agendas. 

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  6

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 6
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> These are all of the user stories required to complete the course management tool. We added user stories for implementing the functionality for TA/grader tasks and sprints, because we need to make these features available to the customer. We added the JSON user stories because we need to provide the ability to load JSON data into the program. We added the daily agenda user story because we need to present a better set of information to the customer. 

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These are all of the user stories needed to complete the project. The user stories involving JSON will have similarities with one another. The other user stories are about tying up loose ends and finishing developing the functionality. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> We feel confident that we know what we need to do and how to achieve our goals.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Attendees  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|   |   |   |   |  |  |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Name1 : Num Meetings

   Name2 : Num Meetings


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We finished most of the required functionality for the program (besides sprints). We also created the ability to load/save to a Data.json file automatically when using the application. 

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We know that most of the team members worked far more than the suggested ~10 hours per week on this project. However, we were not able to achieve everything that was expected. We were unable to implement sprints, and the unit testing is more sparse than would be ideal. Frankly, we just didn’t have enough time. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> No. We failed to implement the sprint-functionality. There may also be a quirk revolving around the .context xml file and it’s use. Besides that, however, we created a well-functioning product that provides accurate information about various todo lists, assignments, and free dates. 


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> No. We failed to implement sprint functionality. We did meet most of our objectives. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> Yes. We did complete all of the stories on our sprint backlog. We did not, however, include creating and managing sprints on the sprint backlog like we originally intended. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Your Answer

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> No. Some of the team members had other obligations, and were unable to provide significant work until after a week. Also, some of the user stories were interdependent, and we were not able to push them to completion status until late into the sprint. 

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes. The program now functions mostly as intended and specified in the requirements, with the exception of the sprint functionality.  

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Our work on this project is concluded. There will be no next sprint. In future projects, we have learned to spend more time on planning and design, so that we do not end up with code that is hard to disentangle. 

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We are very exhausted at this point, having spent as much time as was possible trying to finish this project, as well as preparing for exams and other assignments.
